title:  "Wrangell St. Elias National Park"

---
This trip won't be our first foray in Alaska. In 2019, we did a 2 week long traverse in the St. Elias range in the Wrangell St. Elias National Park and we loved it.

We took inspiration from [this](
https://www.backpacker.com/trips/wrangell-st-elias-national-park-southern-traverse/) Backpacker's Magazine article.

The trip was mostly linking to well known trails, from Tebay Lakes to Bremner, and from Bremner to Iceberg Lakes.
