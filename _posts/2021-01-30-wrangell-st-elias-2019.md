title:  "Wrangell St. Elias National Park"

This trip won't be our first foray into Alaska. In 2019, we did a 2-week long traverse in the St. Elias range in the Wrangell St. Elias National Park. 
[This](
https://www.backpacker.com/trips/wrangell-st-elias-national-park-southern-traverse/) article from the Backpacker's Magazine inspired this traverse. 

We loved it so much that we decided to return to Alaska one day to explore more of this beautiful and wild state.

This traverse, although completeley trailless, was linking somewhat well known routes, from Tebay Lakes to the Bremner Mine, and from Bremner to Iceberg Lakes.
