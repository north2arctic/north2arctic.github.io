<p style="background-color: #e0f5f5;margin-inline-start: 10px;padding:  10px;"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  We are finally updating our blog about our trip back to Alaska in 2023. We plan to release a post every week for the next few weeks, and we will be announcing each post on Salomé’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/salome.staehli/">instagram account</a>.</p>

On September 7th, 2021, we woke up to our last day on our journey. While Ricardo felt proud and was looking forward to the trip ending, Salomé started crying. She was not ready for this adventure to end. 

We had initially planned to cross all of Alaska. But after enduring three weeks in nonstop rain at temperatures barely above freezing on the Lost Coast, Ricardo sprained his ankle. A storm three days later that would last for 7 days made it impossible to cross Icy Bay. It forced us to take a break. We wondered whether we should return to Alaska or give up, as it was clear that we could not do the whole trip anymore. In the end we decided to restart in Denali National Park and make our way back to Icy Bay, skipping the section through the Brooks Range. It ended up being a great decision. We had a wonderful time in the Alaska Range and in the Wrangells, and also enjoyed two weeks on the Lost Coast with much better weather and views. We finally closed the loop at Icy Bay. This time it was sunny, warm and the ocean was glassy, very different from the stormy Icy Bay we experienced at the end of May.

After a successful paddle across the bay, we camped one last time. Both deep in thought, we stared into the fire. Above us the sandhill cranes flew south. Winter was coming. We had closed the loop. Salomé leaned onto Ricardo’s shoulder and quietly whispered into his ear: “Next year we come back and finish the crossing, no?” 

We had made a promise to return. And six months later we started planning the rest of the Alaska crossing in 2022. We enlisted two friends to join us, but both of them had to cancel. We felt relieved. We couldn’t bring ourselves to organize the logistics of this part of the adventure. We realized we were not yet ready for it. While extraordinarily beautiful and filled with many enjoyable moments, the 4.5 months in Alaska had also shown us how hard it was. We had wet feet every day, walked through icy cold rivers every day, fought through brush regularly, and had rain and cold temperatures often. While beautiful, it was often hard, not just physically, but also mentally. And we did not feel strong enough yet to brave the cold, the rain, the rivers, the bears, the mosquitoes, the same food every day, no showers for weeks, or the uncertainty of whether we would succeed.

But this little voice from Icy Bay kept coming back to us. It felt like we had unfinished business in Alaska. And the following year this voice became very loud for Salomé! Ricardo was on board to finish our adventure, after all, he has a particularly bad memory for hard times. 

We started planning -  Salomé packed food for 1.5 months, planned the route and gear. Ricardo organized a food drop by bush plane in the Brooks Range, logistics around biking the Haul Road, and prepared our lame city bikes for the needs of bikepacking and gravel roads. Leaving was as hard as the first time. Salomé was still recovering from jet lag from a work trip, and Ricardo was recovering from food poisoning as we got on the plane to Fairbanks. We like to travel light, but this time we checked in more bags than ever before: A backpack full of gear, two bikes, a large bag of food for our section from Fairbanks to the Brooks Range, and a box of food for the second part of the hiking section through the Brooks Range. This is in addition to three more boxes of food we had shipped from the post office just before heading to the airport. 

As we boarded the plane, doubts we knew so well came up: “Will we be able to do this? The Brooks Range is more remote than we have ever been before. Did we plan for everything? How will the weather be? How bad will the mosquitoes be?”
