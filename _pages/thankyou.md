We have been helped by many people already, even before leaving our house.

- [Hig and Erin](http://www.aktrekking.com/aboutUs.html): The authors of [A Long Trek Home](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/Book/) jumped on a video call with us, pointed us to a ton of resources and answered all our questions! Thanks!
