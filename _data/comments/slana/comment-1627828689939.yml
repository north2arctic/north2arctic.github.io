  I love reading about your trip!  You are doing things that make me have good
  dreams. I go over your pictures from the very beginning and I’m longing to be
  at some of those remote places. It’s another beautiful day here and I’m
  heading to the lighthouse with someone who I staying there for five weeks. On
  our way to pull crab pots then Seattle for a celebration of life.  Best of
  luck to both of you. Jeff
