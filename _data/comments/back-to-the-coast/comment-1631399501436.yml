  I love your pictures and the description of your hike. Sounds like the rain
  was abundant! I got my mom and her friends to the lighthouse for two nights
  and spent a day at leConte glacier. I’m heading to Seattle for the third time
  Susan’s sister is still with us. Call when you get home. Jeff
