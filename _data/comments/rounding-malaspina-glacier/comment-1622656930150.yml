  You are experiencing the Alaska most people never see. Kudos for your
  perseverance in the face of many obstacles.  And how fortunate to see all the
  beauty that surrounds you, despite the dangers. Love the photos which allow me
  to visualize the incredible landscape.  Good luck with all those mosquitoes!
