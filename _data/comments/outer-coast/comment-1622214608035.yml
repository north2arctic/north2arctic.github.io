  Wow, it's so inspiring to read your trip reports, and the pictures are simply
  stunning!  On those days when you question why you are doing (and enduring :)
  ) what you're doing, just remember how amazing and special your trip is - how
  it's feeding your adventurous spirits, and giving you an opportunity to see
  and experience so many wild and wondrous things up close and in person!  You
  both are tough and courageous and inspiring...I'm here cheering you on!  Thank
  you for sharing your adventures... looking forward to the next trip report!
  :)  -Marian
