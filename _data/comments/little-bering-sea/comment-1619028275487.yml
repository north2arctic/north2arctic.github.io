message: "Hig contacted me and sent me a link to your blog.  My wife and I live in Juneau and it would be fun to meet up.  We also have a cabin on Shelter Island you could stay at if you are going that way.  Please let me know where you are and if we can get together.\r\nCheers, - Greg Chaney\r\nHere is a link to the documentary I made about Hig and Erin's expedition \"Journey on the Wild Coast\":\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kxot1TzJFTPGxTSq1urxl9ja-IoCgzGn/view"
