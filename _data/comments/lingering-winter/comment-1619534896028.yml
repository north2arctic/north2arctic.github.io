message: "Hi you two!\r\nReceived you letter, wonderful, written letters are like treasures from the last century - with a smell of wolverine blood or so.\r\nAnd great to read from you, day by day. Have a nice trip! \r\nIf by chance you cross Eagle (Tthee T’äwdlenn in Hän Athabascan) on the south bank of the Yukon River near the Canada–US border in the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area - remember Amundsen, Roald"
