  These are great descriptions. Thank you Salom√© and Ricardo! I am going to
  vicariously live your journey through these posts. The Alaskan training leg
  sounds like a pretty good outcome in the end and although there are still some
  things to sort it sounds like there are heaps of positives/things that are
  working well. Great planning to date and can't wait for next pics and blog. I
  really loved the blue sky paddling photo! And orcas - dreams already being
  realised.
