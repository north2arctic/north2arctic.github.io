message: "Thanks Bea! A map associated to each post would be amazing! Wished I had thought of that before. Most of the time looking at the forest service maps on sites like hillmap.com would be more useful than Google Maps.\r\n\r\nJeff, canâ€™t wait to walk on those beaches. Today the beach are Lynn Canal sucked, it was full of slippery rocks."
